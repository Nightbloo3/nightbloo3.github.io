<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Currently I am a graduate student of Applied Linguistics in the College of Foreign Languages and Literature at Fudan University. I received my bachelor's degree of Art from Ocean University of China, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yingying Liu](https://flc.ouc.edu.cn/2021/1022/c12471a353865/page.htm) during my undergraduate years. <br> <br> My research interests are primarily in second language acquisition, Complex Dynamic Systems Theory, corpus linguistics, English for Academic Purposes, and intelligent computer-assisted language learning. I am particularly interested in examining second language development (especially L2 writing) by means of a corpus-based approach. I also have a longstanding interest in technology-enhanced language learning, such as how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be employed in language learning, teaching, and assessment. My work appears in _System_, _Applied Linguistics_ and _Journal of Second Language Studies_.
